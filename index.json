With Github Page, we could easily set up a personal website for free. And using Hugo, you can have access to hundreds of special themes to choose from.\nFor me, I\u0026rsquo;m using Mac OS system and plan to build up this website from command line. Below is a detailed tutorial of how I successfully set up my website from scratch - Stay Tuned!\nLink to my Github repository\n Install Hugo and Git  First open the terminal, and input the following command-line. Note that if you do not have homebrew installed, you may need to install it first.\nbrew install hugo I recommend installing Git as well. run git --version in your command-line for checking.\n Build on local machine  Make sure to sit inside the directory to save the website. And run the following to initialize a new site:\ncd /Users/yuanfeng/Desktop hugo new site site_name Then, we should have a new folder with the name we just made. It will come with a list of folders, and we will dig deeper into those folders in a minute.\n Select a theme  I personally enjoy designs of minimalist and the use of white or black as its main colors. It only takes googling to find ready-to-go themes but it took me a while to find my favorite.\nThen I run the following command line in the terminal to download the contents in themes folder:\ncd site_name cd themes git clone https://github.com/themefisher/academia-hugo And it\u0026rsquo;s also necessary to make sure the configurations are correct. Here I made some changes in the config.toml.\nbaseurl = \u0026#34;https://[your github username].github.io/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;the website title shown on the tab\u0026#34; theme = \u0026#34;the same as theme name (exactly the folder name) in your themes folder\u0026#34;  Test locally  I wanted to see how the webpage currently looks like by running the following:\ncd site_name hugo server The following indicated success in running it locally. By going to http://localhost:1313/ in my web browser, I could see my work so far and observe changes real-time.\nBuilt in 4 ms Watching for changes in /Users/yuanfeng/site/yuan/{archetypes,content,data,layouts,static} Watching for config changes in /Users/yuanfeng/site/yuan/config.toml Environment: \u0026#34;development\u0026#34; Serving pages from memory Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop  Personalize my website  The template comes with a variety of different sections such as Publications, Recent Posts and Contact. However, in order for the main page to stay concise and minimal, I removed the less appealing and related components and replaced the sample photos and texts with mine by editing html and md files.\nAnother main change compared with the original template is the header and dropdown. This turned out to be tricky as I needed to tweak the Javascript code as well. The final results seem great!\n Deploy to Git Pages  Last step is to render my website to Github Pages. I started by running the following commnad, which will generate a folder called public and it will contain the required web files.\ncd site_name hugo  Create Github Repository  I wanted to publish my site as my github name. In order to do that, I created a new branch named \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io. and set it to public.\nThen the following command could sync the website to my github.\ncd public git init git add . git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git git commit -m ‚Äúfirst commit‚Äù git push origin master After completing the committing, I went to my repository and clicked on settings, then scrolled to the section of Github Pages. It successfully returned the link of my personal website:\nhttps://yuan-feng1.github.io/\nAnd my personal website was successfully published.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for this blog.
